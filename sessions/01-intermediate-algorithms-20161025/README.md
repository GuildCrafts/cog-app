- Practitioner: @tannerwelsh
- Format: remote
- Date: 2016/10/25

### Task

Complete the [Spinal Tap Case](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/spinal-tap-case) and [DNA Pairing](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/dna-pairing) challenges from goal #84.

Goal: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues/84

#### Tools & concepts used
- JavaScript
- algorithms

#### Skills covered
- computational thinking
- algorithm design

### Preparation

Review or try the two problems of the day (i.e. "Spinal Tap Case" and "DNA Pairing" from goal #84) so that you have context.

Consider if this problem is in your ZPD (if not, then this session might not be as useful/interesting to you.

Take note of any relevant concepts/skills/techniques that you'd like to focus on during observation or ask about during reflection (e.g. "observe: how the practitioner breaks down the problem" or "reflect: how does big-O notation relate to this problem?")
